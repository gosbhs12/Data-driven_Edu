# Topic Model
I want to get a topic for each document data. Preprocessing the data, unnecessary words are cut off. Based on keywords, created topics and found the optimal number of topics. Each keywords from a document has a score for the topics. 
- Visualized graph that shows topic by the number of the document data.
